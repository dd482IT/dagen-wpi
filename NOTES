How to use a Kotlin QueryGroup value during the build to generate queries?
  Put on classpath of query gen run and then accessed via reflection I guess?

Add Kotlin output option.


If an identical type has already been generated, do not write it to output.
  Still return it in generated types list?  E.g. top type is required to be returned.
