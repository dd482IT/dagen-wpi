    data via single query operation. Traditional joins have problems pulling
    data from independent child tables with a parent table.
  - Preamble about query group and options applying to all queries.
  - Top table and list of fields to include, without any field options, default
    json field naming.  Always introduced with "tableJson" (bold), same rules/
    format wherever it appears in the tree.
  - Field options
    - Customize json field name
    - Using expression values
      - alias syntax
        - simple calculation
        - subselect
  - Including fields from parent tables (inline parent tables)
  - Including parent tables as objects references (wrapped parent values)
