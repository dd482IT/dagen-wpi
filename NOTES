App should make a separate maven project within db directory 
  Kotlin query defs as source code, sqljson-query as a dependency.
  When this project is run, it call sqljson-query generator functions as library.
    Database metadata file refresh (opitional).
    Queries and types generation, targeting main app resource and generated sources directories.
  
  

  
Maybe just script generation of yaml file from query-specs.kt?
  Run it as Kotlin script with sqljson-query on classpath.

How to use a Kotlin QueryGroup value during the build to generate queries?
  Put on classpath of query gen run and then accessed via reflection I guess?

Add Kotlin output option.


If an identical type has already been generated, do not write it to output.
  Still return it in generated types list?  E.g. top type is required to be returned.
