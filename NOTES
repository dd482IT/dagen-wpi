If an identical type has already been generated, do not write it to output.
  Still return it in generated types list?  E.g. top type is required to be returned.


Kotlin DSL for query specs?
  Would allow IDE assistance, auto-completion, etc.
  How would the QueriesSpec data structure produced by the DSL be accessed by the build tool?
    Put on classpath of query gen run and then accessed via reflection I guess?
